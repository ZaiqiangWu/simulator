# VISGSim


VISGSim is a GPU-based cloth simulator.

# CONTRIBUTIONS

  - A unified streaming pipeline for time integration and collision handling
  - Unified collision handling: we present a parallel, integrated collision detection and response algorithm - Position projection and inelastic collision response force
  - A new strategy of expanding bounding box(aabb) for the triangle (caused by our collision detection and response strategy)
  - Maximizing Parallelism in the construction of BVHs


### Here is a [Demo](https://youtu.be/e-qQirf1UiY).
  - 12367 vertices
  - intel core i5 and GTX 960
  - nearly 1000 FPS
  
### Operations
* space - start or stop the simulation
* 'W'/'w' - down in the axis '-y'
* 'S'/'s' - up in the axis 'y'
* 'X'/'x' - snapshot
* mouse - press *middle* and drag to scale, press *left* and drag to rotate
